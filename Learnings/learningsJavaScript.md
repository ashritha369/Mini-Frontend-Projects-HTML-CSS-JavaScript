## Use of The preventDefault().

- The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur. For example, this can be useful when: Clicking on a "Submit" button, prevent it from submitting a form. Clicking on a link, prevent the link from following the URL
